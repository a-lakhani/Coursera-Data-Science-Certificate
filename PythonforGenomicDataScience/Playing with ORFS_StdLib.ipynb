    "ORFs are delimited by a start codon ('ATG' in the case of DNA and 'UAG' in the case of RNA), and an \"in-frame\" stop codon. *Typically* in DNA and RNA, these correspond to 'TAA', 'TAG', and 'TGA', or 'UAA', 'UAG', and 'UGA' respectively. \"In-frame\" means the number of bases between the stop and start codons is a multiple of 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "'ATGATAA' contains two codons (groups of three bases): 'ATG' and 'ATA'. Even though 'TAA' is present in the sequence, it is not recognized as a stop codon because the number of intervening nucleotides is not a multiple of 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find an ORF is to find the first instance of 'ATG', str.find() instances of 'TAA', 'TAG', and 'TGA' following the start codon. The first tricky bit is that str.find() only searches for a particular sequence and only returns the index of the first location, so we would need separate iterations for each stop codon sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    "Regular expressions can express this problem concisely, in an \"ancient magic\" sort of way. This comes at the price of readability and speed: regex can be more than an order of magnitude slower than built-ins: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8958229/is-a-regular-expression-faster-than-using-replace>. However if you want to show how `1337` you are and like Googling how your own code works when you have to look at it six months later, regex is the way to go.\n",

    "Quick breakdown of the expression used below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expressions in parenthesis indicate logical separations. `(ATG)` means look for the first instance of the sequence `ATG`. \n",
    "  - Square brackets `[ATG]` would just look for the first instance of 'A' and/or 'T' and/or 'G'. Any of these characters in any order would be sufficient to start the next stage of the search.\n",
    "- `(\\S{3})`: `\\S` (not to be confused with `\\s`!) is a wildcard for any non-whitespace character. The slash needs to be escaped unless using a raw string. \n",
    "  - Braces `{}` are notation for repetition: `{3}` means repeats of 3. Regex also supports looking for a range of repeats, such as `{min,[max]}`.\n",
    "  - The `\\s` could also be replaced by sequences such as `[ATGUCatguc]` or `[A-Z,a-z]`, but DNA and RNA sequences sometimes contain whitespaces between codons.  \n",
    "- `*` means \"zero or more instances\". Combined with the previous expression, `(.{3})*` means \"look for one or more repeats of 3.\n",
    "- `*` uses \"greedy\" evaluation, meaning it will keep going as far as it can and then work backwards to fulfill the rest of the conditions. This yields the maximum number of the preceding expression that still fulfills the other conditions for the expression. So if the expression could be satisfied by a sequence containing 5 or 50 repeats of 3, greedy evaluation would return the sequence containing 50 repeats. This is not what we want! We don't want to read through valid stop codons, we want to stop at stop codons.\n",
    "- `*?` reigns in `*` and switches to lazy evaluation. This means it stops once it finds an expression that satisfies the necessary conditions. This is the intended behavior here. \n",
    " - `??` is super lazy, and looks for the lesser of 0 or 1 of the previous clause.\n",
    "\n",

The most obvious difference is how convenient they are to define, similar to named tuples. With the `@dataclass` decorator, one does not even have to define `__init__`, much less `__str__` or `__repr__`, along with a whole host of other methods like comparisons and hashing. \n",
